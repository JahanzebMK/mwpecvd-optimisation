**ï»¿Using Machine Learning to Optimise the MW-PECVD Process for Polymer Substrates in Industry**

This was my final year project during my mechanical engineering degree which involved exploring different machine learning models and optimising them to be suitable for developing an optimisation tool for the MW-PECVD process in industry. 

The models trained and the optimisation tool are included in the 'Code' folder. The optimisation tool should be run in two parts - Program A first and then Program B second. The data used to train these models can be found in Code/Data.

The project report and presentation slides are also available which document the journey I took and my working throughout.
